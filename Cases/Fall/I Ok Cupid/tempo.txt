Scenario
You are part of a business intelligence team at okcupid.com. The team has been asked to make an in-depth exploratory analysis of site users. The marketing team must use the two CSV files provided for this analysis, which aims to create micro-segments and personas for future campaigns. Remember, data correlations may not be beneficial in a marketing context. For example, identifying five users with specific attributes may be interesting, but it is hardly a segment worth attracting. 
You are asked to examine the data, clean it, use supplemental data to enrich the data, and then identify four or more interesting insights from the user data.  All relevant cleaning, enriching, and EDA steps, along with the four insightful data nuances, should be organized into a presentation.  You will present to the head of marketing who is looking for an “ah–ha” persona or previously unknown data relationship between two or more interactions.   As the head of marketing, relevant information is consumed visually instead of in table form.  Thus, your presentation should include visualizations when appropriate.  You will need to turn in code and PowerPoint slides.
